            <div class="about-text">
                <p><strong>How this came about -</strong> We can all DO BETTER - we don't have to wait until we are sick
                    to take improving steps for our bodies and mind.</p>
                <p>I have always had an inherent inquisitive interest in health, anatomy, physiology, fitness and
                    astrology. I have studied orthomolecular medicine in detail in a laymen's capacity for the past 18
                    years and as the years went on I realised how powerful this is as an alternative to mainstream
                    pharmaceuticals at healing the body without side effects.</p>

                <p><strong>About me:</strong> I am British born and currently live in Johannesburg, South Africa at 26S
                    and 28E. The latitude becomes important for health when we investigate circadian biology. I live
                    near my adult children, whom I raised on mainly orthomolecular principles where possible.</p>

                <p>I'm also a professional astrologer specialising in medical astrology, but I do normal birth charts
                    transits and synastry charts for couples.</p>

                    <h3>Important Note</h3>
                    <p>I am not a doctor, but a healer or HEALTH coach. I don't prescribe medicines but suggest
                        lifestyle changes and orthomolecular protocols for your INDIVIDUAL NEEDS.</p>
